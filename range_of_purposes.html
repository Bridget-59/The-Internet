        <p>The Internet is used for voice communication through Audio  Conferencing, Video Conferencing and VoIP.<br>
			<strong>Audio Conferencing</strong> is an audio call  between two or more computers which dial into a central system which connects  them.  Using a microphone and speakers enables  communication and collaboration simultaneously.   Many audio conferencing products contain online collaboration elements  like screen-sharing which further enhances the value of audio meetings.  An example of this would be Skype.  (Mitel, 2022)</p>

      (Skype, 2023)</p>
	
		<p><strong>Video Conferencing</strong>  works like audio conferencing with the added advantage of all the participants  being able to see each other by using webcams.   Also called virtual meeting or web conferencing, video conferencing  became extremely popular during the Covid pandemic when businesses, schools and  others had to go online rather than having face to face interaction.<br>  Examples of video conferencing would be  Microsoft Teams and Zoom (Webex, 2023) </p>

<p>(Zoom, 2023)  </p>
		<p><strong>VoIP</strong> means &ldquo;Voice  Over Internet Protocol&rdquo; and it refers to a system of communicating over the  internet via computer, a VoIP phone or by using an analog telephone adapter  connected to the network.  With VoIP,  analog voice calls are converted into packets of data, which travel over the  internet and for the best voice quality and security a private IP network could  be used.  Using a VoIP service you can  also call landline or mobile phones.  (Cisco, 2023)<br><br>
          How VoIP works versus how Public Switched Telephone Network  (PSTN) works:</p>

<h2 id= "MyHeading2" style="padding-top: 60px">Written Communication</h2>
		<br>
		
		<p><strong>E-Mail</strong> is short  for electronic mail which is the transmission of messages over the internet, an  email can be sent to single or multiple recipients and can be instantly sent to  anywhere in the world.  Once you have the  recipient&rsquo;s email address a message which can contain text, files, images or  other attachments can be sent, using email software such as Microsoft Outlook  or Eudora.  It is imperative that the  email software is protected by up to date anti-virus programmes as junk mail or  spam emails can contain viruses which can quickly spread and cause serious  damage depending on the purpose of these types of viruses.  For relatively little an anti-virus plan may  be purchased e.g. Norton AntiVirus:<br><br>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><strong>Instant Messaging</strong>  or IM is one of the fastest growing forms of internet communications.  IM is used by millions of people daily to  contact family and friends due to its real-time nature as the message appears  instantly on the recipient&rsquo;s screen, either on a smartphone, computer or other  electronic device with internet connection.   WhatsApp is among the most popular site for private use but instant  messaging is also becoming popular in the business world for communication and  collaboration.  A chatbot is a type of  instant messaging where software simulates human-like conversations with users  to answer predictable questions and are widely used as a customer service.  Microsoft Teams has an instant messaging app  called Chat, there is even an app to keep all chats in one place:<br>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Internet Relay Chat</strong>  (IRC) is also a well-known means of communication where people all over the  world can exchange text messages.  This  method requires an IRC client and a channel on a selected network.  The IRC client sends the messages to an IRC  server from which all the messages are broadcast.  Messages can be shared with just one person  or a number of people.  IRC is used by  both individuals and businesses because it facilitates text-based communications  on a group basis and can be topic driven.   The disadvantage of IRC is lag which may be helped by reconnecting on a  different server.<br>

        <br clear="all">
		<p><strong>SMS &amp; Wireless  Communications</strong> Short message service is the protocol used for sending short  messages over wireless networks.  Unlike  other instant messaging services as earlier described, SMS works on the  fundamental voice rather than the data part of the wireless network.  It was originally developed for GSM networks  but are still running on modern networks like 4G and 5G.  It allows for up to messages of 160 alphanumeric  characters in length and cannot contain images or graphics.  The message is received by a Short Message  Service Centre, (SMSC) which forward it to the appropriate device or  system.  Multimedia Messaging Service,  (MMS) evolved which provided enabled the sending of text, sounds, images and  video to handsets which were MMS capable.   These simple messages require a surprising amount of coordination and  technology working in the background to be sent.  Wireless communications are continuously  upgrading and improving and wireless devices like the smartphone is now a mini  computer and with an internet account all of the functions discussed can be  accessed.  Smart watches are relatively  new and also have multi functions available on them. <br>
          Each character in an SMS message is defined by a 7-bits GSM alphabet that  covers both Latin and Greek letters.  For  example, 48656C6C6F is the GSM  alphabet equivalent of the word Hello.  The data format for the messages are  described by the protocol description unit (PDU) which forms a string of  hexadecimal-octets and semi decimal-octets.  </p>

<h2 id= "MyHeading3" style="padding-top: 60px">Information Search</h2>
	

        <p>In the modern world a vast collection of information is  available on the World Wide Web simply by using a web browser.  A browser is a software application used to  locate, retrieve and display content including Web pages, images, video and  other files.  Familiar browsers would be  Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari, Yahoo and Firefox Mozilla.  The search engine is a program that searches  for specific keywords and returns a list of the documents where the keywords  are found.  Another program called an  Indexer reads these documents and creates an index based on the words contained  in each document.  By using a proprietary  algorithm it creates its indices which will produce the best return for each  query.  These indices are giant databases  of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched.  Google is the largest public internet search  engine and has billions of web pages on its indices.  There are tips available on how to get the  best result from your search for example using quotation marks &ldquo; &ldquo; in your  search will result in the engine only searching for the exact words within the  quotation marks. <br>
          A new addition to web is Chatgpt which is an OpenAI powered assistant that  helps people find relevant information quickly, it is in fact a chatbot that  generates human like responses to searches.</p>

<h2 id= "MyHeading4" style="padding-top: 60px">File Sharing</h2>
	

		<p><strong>File Sharing</strong> is  the term relating to sharing files in a network.  File sharing allows several people to use the  same file, different people may be given different levels of access and their  access may allow them to read, view, print, edit or copy the files or a  combination thereof.  The level of access  privilege is given by an administrator on the file sharing system.  In the pre-cloud days file sharing meant  copying files to a disc and physically delivering the disc to others.  Files were also attached to emails but  security concerns now discourage this practice.   Cloud offers endless options for file sharing with Google, Microsoft,  Apple, Box and Dropbox offering online cloud storage that include file sharing  with collaboration features. Each company offer a certain amount of free use  but businesses generally opt for a paid plan which includes extras like the  collaboration app and calendar apps etc.    (Computerworld, 2021)</p>
		
        <p>An example a file share system is 4shared:</p>
		<img src="images/4Shared.png" width="775" height="718" alt=""/>
<p>(4Shared, 2023)</p>
		
	  <h2>File Downloading:</h2>
		<p><strong>Peer-to-peer file  sharing</strong> software connects users in a network enabling them to search for  shared files on the computers of other users connected to the network. Files  can then be downloaded directly from other users on the network.  Larger files are broken down into smaller  chunks and reassembled by the downloader.   Again P2P file sharing software have been known to spread viruses and  malware so care must be taken when downloading.   Piracy can also be a problem with P2P.<br>
          Examples of peer-to-peer file sharing applications are Napster, BitTorrent,  PirateBay and Limewire.</p>
		<img src="images/LimeWire.png" width="700" height="409" alt=""/>
<p>(LimeWire , 2022)<br><br>
	<strong>File Hosting Services</strong>  are a simple alternative to peer-to-peer software, it is an internet  hosting service specifically designed to host user files.  It allows users to upload files that could  then be accessed over the internet using an authentication method and  downloaded.  Microsoft OneDrive and  Google Workspace provide file hosting services for businesses. (HostingAdvice,   2023)<br><br>
	<strong>File Sync and sharing</strong>  is the process where data files are updated in real-time across multiple  devices.  Businesses use an enterprise  file sync and sharing service to avail of increased security, flexibility and  control.  The files can be accessed  anywhere, data is protected from a cybersecurity attack or lost or stolen  devices as data is easily backed up and stored securely.  Files are accessed through a website or  mobile app and can be easily shared with others for viewing or collaboration.<br>
      Again Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox like many cloud storage  providers offer all of the above as part of their packages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>E-Commerce:</h2>
		<p><strong>E-Commerce</strong> is electronically buying and selling online, from  the placing of orders to making payments online.  Product sellers and service providers can  increase sales through online commerce and selling online is a popular sales  method worldwide.  E-commerce has greatly  increased due to the pandemic as people were unable or avoided going to  shops.  Businesses had to quickly adjust  their websites to enable E-Commerce and to stay in business.  Like with E-Business there is B2B (business  to business) and B2C (business to consumer) and both are done through the  website.  With B2B businesses often use  an automated service where purchasing of necessary items are ordered based on  stock quantities.  <br>
          The E-Commerce industry is a vast as the internet and data shows that global  E-Commerce sales could reach to nearly a quarter of all retail sales worldwide  this year.  It is now possible to set up  a retail business without having a physical store and Amazon are a prime  example of this.  Digital marketing must  be fully utilised to attract customers and this includes email marketing,  online advertising and search engine optimisation.  Tracking of orders is also easily facilitated  from the order confirmation email which generally contains a tracking number.</p>
