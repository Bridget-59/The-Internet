		<h2 id= "MyHeading1" style="padding-top: 60px">Content Management System (CMS)</h2>
        <p>A content management system helps companies manage digital  content.  It organises and facilitates  collaborative creation of documents and other content using built-in (or  designed) workflows.  Different privileges  and responsibilities can be provided to individuals based on their roles within  the business.  <br>
          While it can apply to any computer software system CMS is used more  specifically to manage websites and web content.  Nearly every CMS is comprised of two parts,  the front end and the back end, with the front end being the part the user  interacts with and the back end being the application that is used to post new  content to a website.  <br>
          The process begins by accessing a web interface to easily add, create and  publish content to a business&rsquo;s front end.   So instead of having to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript the content is  created in an interface similar to Word which the back end stores in the  database and publishes it to the front end of the business&rsquo;s website.  Together these two systems comprise the CMS,  allowing a business to publish content without understanding web technologies  or creating the website from the beginning.   Database technologies with its own programming language as well as  another programming language to pass information between the database and the  part of the website that user&rsquo;s access and navigate is complicated.  <br>
          A CMS can streamline the content creation and distribution process enabling a  business get the best value of their content in four key areas: stronger  collaboration and organisation, user friendly in ease of use, improve search  engine optimisation and drive traffic to the website and allows more time to  spend on producing quality content.  <br>
          There are open source solutions that can provide free CMS which will keep costs  down, the best known being Joomla! which does not require technical experience  to set-up a website and once established can be easily edited but can be  expensive to support and maintain.   Bigger businesses will most likely purchase a specially designed system  from a provider such as Oracle.

<h2 id= "MyHeading2" style="padding-top: 60px">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h2>
	  <p>Customer relationship management is a system for managing a  company&rsquo;s relationships and interactions with current and future customers by  improving business relationships thereby growing the business.  The system stores customer information,  identify sales opportunities, record service issues and manage marketing  campaigns, all in one central location and makes this information about every  customer available to anyone in the company that needs it.  This access to data makes it easier to  collaborate and increase productivity.  A  good CRM gathers information from lots of sources across the business and  beyond, getting insights into how customers feel and what they are saying about  the business.  <br>
		  Cloud based CRM systems such as Salesforce mean every user has the same  information all the time.  Data can be  updated by any user from anywhere, making it instantly available to other users  who need it.  Cloud based systems can be  quickly and easily implemented as there is no hardware to be set up on multiple  devices, no version control and updates to be scheduled, keeping IT costs low. (Salesforce,   2023)</p>

<p>Other CRM system providers are Sage and Microsoft  Dynamics365 with HubSpot being the best overall CRM software in 2021: (CRM, 2023)</p>

<h2 id= "MyHeading3" style="padding-top: 60px" >Payment Systems</h2>
		<p>All businesses rely on getting paid in full and on time in  order to stay in business!  This is also  the case with E-businesses and today there are numerous online payment  options.  A study found that websites  providing four of more payment methods as well as credit cards have a sales  conversion rate of 12% higher than those offering credit cards and just one  online option.  <br>
			<strong>Credit cards</strong> are still the most  widely used method of online payment and a business needs an Internet merchant  account in order to set up credit card processing on their website.  To get an Internet merchant account a  business may need to deal with two separate banks.  On checking with the two main banks, Bank of  Ireland and AIB, I found that they are in fact offering Third party Internet  Merchant Accounts which are quickly set up and can contain ecommerce service  packages that include the Internet gateway needed for online credit card  processing and a shopping cart.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Third Party Internet  Merchant Accounts</strong> are a good option also as they do not usually require any  security deposits and are quickly set up.   Examples are Merchant Accounts, Beanstream, Moneris, PSiGate and InternetSecure.  Beanstream have in fact recently evolved to  Bambora:<br><br>

		<p><strong>Internet Gateway  Service</strong> is required to verify information, transfers request and authorises  credit cards in real time.  It is the  software that links a business&rsquo;s shopping cart to the payment processing  network.  <br>
			<strong>All-in-one online  payment solutions</strong> like PayPal, Stripe, Square and Amazon offer a payment  solutions that do not require a merchant account.  The transaction rates for these vary from 1.9%  to 2.9% per transaction and all but Square also charge a transaction fee.  <strong>PayPal</strong>  became known through the ecommerce giant eBay and is a favourite payment option  for customers and PayPal&rsquo;s gateway, Payflow is extremely popular with online  businesses.  <strong>Square</strong> is cheaper than PayPal and offers attractive free features  for small businesses.  <strong>Stripe</strong> offers a business a payment form  that is embedded directly into their website so that customers pay while  remaining on the business&rsquo;s website, it also works across multiple devices and  even accepts Bitcoin.  <strong>Amazon</strong> had two payment products;  Checkout By Amazon (CBA) was an ecommerce solution that allowed businesses to  accept Amazon account information and use Amazon for payment processing but it  was discontinued in Europe in 2016 and in the US in 2017, Amazon Pay requires  an Amazon account and once a customer purchases using their login a business  will get their name, email address and post address from Amazon.  This information is valuable for marketing  the customer directly.  This payment  method also keeps customers on the Amazon site unlike Stripe.  <br>

        <p><strong>Sumup</strong> has become  very popular with small retail businesses like coffee shops, hairdressers and  even doctors rooms.  It also offers a  service for remote payments with the use of a Payments Link with a transaction  fee of 1.69%.  Sumup also provide prom  material for business to use to let their customers about paying through Sumup.  (Sumup, 2023)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> uses  peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks, managing  transactions and issuing bitcoins is carried out by the network.  Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public,  nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and it can be used to pay for goods and  services.  Bitcoin has recently lost  value on the open market and its volatility may not make it very popular as a  payment method.  Customers may be nervous  when paying by bitcoin as they have to establish that a seller is legitimate,  the wallet address is correct and that the service is compatible for refunds  purposes.  </p>

        <h2>Offline Payment Options</h2>
        <p>Customers who are not comfortable with online options must  also be catered for.  It is important to  give these customers an option to pay over the phone by providing a toll-free  number on the website.  An order form  that customers can fill out and email or even mail will ensure that a business  maximises its sales.</p>
<h2 id= "MyHeading4" style="padding-top: 60px">Supply Chain Management Systems</h2>
		
	  <p>Supply chain management is the management of the flow of  products, flow of information and the finances flow.  Product flow would include raw materials as  well as finished goods and any returns or service needs.  The information flow covers stock levels,  procurement, customer orders and delivery status.  The financial flow will have details of  credit terms, payment options and schedules and consignment and title ownership  of goods.  Supply chain management is the  coordination and integration of these flows both within and among  manufacturers, suppliers, wholesale and retail.   Just in Time is the ultimate goal of an effective supply chain  management system as if it when everything goes to plan it reduces the amount  of inventory a company has to hold.  This  system has been dealt a number of knocks recently firstly with Covid in 2019, Brexit  in 2020, the blockage of the Suez Canal in March 2021 followed by the war in  Ukraine in February 2022.   <br>
		  Within a SCM there are planning applications which use algorithms to determine  the best way to fill an order and execution applications which track the  physical status of goods, the management of materials and the financial  information.  The planning systems forecast  customer demand and adjust the speed and flow of production accordingly.  This is further improved by the use of  multi-dimensional forecasting which allows users to view information through  different filters, by market, time or customer and runs &ldquo;what if&rdquo; simulations  to project demand.  SCM systems also have  VMI systems, supplier relationship solutions, procurement software and order  fulfilment software which together automate orders, monitor suppliers and  payments and decrease lead times to order fulfilment.  SCM software not only increases efficiency it  reduces costs and provides valuable trend analysis and business  intelligence.     <br>
		  SAP and Oracle were among the top providers of supply chain management software  in 2021.</p>
